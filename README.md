Build Instructions
==================

Here is where you give specific instructions about how the device is built. The more detail the better -- especially if your build is very complicated. Here you should include schematics of your build:

And a breadboard view is also a good idea. It gives the potential user a better idea of how to put the thing together. So we'll throw one in here as well.

If there are any special instructions on how to assemble the hardware, we should note it here as well. For example, if the user should solder things in a specific order, you should give them a heads-up. 

Usage
=====
This is usually where you tell the user how the device works. Do you just upload the software and flip a switch? What sort of things does this thing do? Are there alternate settings / modes / programs that might be good to mention. This is where you tell the user exactly how the device or program is used. For example: 

* Upload the code to the thing. 
* Turn the thing on. 
* The thing will do a thing and it'll be really cool. 
* Don't forget to feed the badgers!
